# cuboid.githu.io
#This is a python program that calculates volume, Surface_area, and perimeter of a Cuboid
#This code defines a function called "cuboid" that calculates various properties of a cuboid (a three-dimensional rectangular shape). Specifically, it calculates and returns three values:

Surface Area: It calculates the surface area of the cuboid.
Perimeter: It calculates the perimeter, which in the context of a cuboid is the sum of the lengths of all its edges.
Volume: It calculates the volume of the cuboid.
The code then calls the "cuboid" function with specific values for length (l), width (w), and height (h), and prints out these three values. It's a way to compute and display these geometric properties for a given cuboid with the dimensions provided (length of 50, width of 100, and height of 60).
